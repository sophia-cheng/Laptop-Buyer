This skill is meant to help people purchase laptops by helping them gain insight on the best laptops on the market in a consumer-friendly way.

Start the Laptop Buyer skill by saying the following sentence:
"Alexa, open Laptop Buyer and let's talk" 
--> the last phrase "let's talk" may be replaced with a similar phrase; examples include, "talk to me", "ask me", and "start asking".

Alexa will say "Hi, what are you concerned with most when purchasing a laptop?" and you can voice what concern you have in your mind or ask for what categories she covers by saying "what are my choices" or "give me some choices" or something similar. You will find that the options are money, quality, and innovation. 

Reply to Alexa with "money", "quality", or "innovation". Saying "price" or "affordability" works the same as saying "money" in this skill.

Alexa will reply and list the best brands in your category (that you provided by telling her which concern you had):
"The best brands for _________ are ___, ___, ___, ____ ,____. Which would you like to choose?"

Here, a potentially useful intent for real Alexa users is brandOptions, and they can use it when they need to hear the brand options again. they can do this by saying "what were my brand options again" or "repeat the brands again" or something similar.

Reply with one of the brand names that Alexa lists. Example: "Dell", "I like Dell", or something similar.

Alexa will reply with a laptop recommendation or two, depending on how many laptops from tha brand fits into that category well.

Here, you can request for additional information about the laptops that Alexa just recommended. You can say "give me more information", "tell me more", or phrases that are similar. Alexa will reply with more information on that specific laptop or laptops.
