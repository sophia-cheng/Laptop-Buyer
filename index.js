insert code
The lambda function itself in the form of index.js also must be submitted. All documentation for found code must be shown by commenting
above the used code on where it came from. This should always include the url for where you found it. If documentation is not given and it is found
that you used code from another source, this can be grounds for plagiarism and will result in a zero on the final.
