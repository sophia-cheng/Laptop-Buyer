# Laptop-Buyer
Documentation for your project in the form of a file called README.txt. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the
structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the user how to use your Alexa Skill and why they should use
it. It should not be necessary for a user to ask questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be
sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think a user might have while using your skill.

Start the Laptop Buyer skill by saying the following sentence:
"Alexa, open Laptop Buyer and let's talk"  -->the last phrase "let's talk" may be replaced with a similar phrase; examples                                                       include, "talk to me", "ask me", and "start asking".
